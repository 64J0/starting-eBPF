#+TITLE: Starting eBPF
#+AUTHOR: 64J0

This repository is used to keep track of the programs I write while starting to
learn about eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter) technology.

The main reference for this journey is the book [[https://github.com/lizrice/learning-ebpf][Learning eBPF]] from Liz Rice.

* What is eBPF?

eBPF is a revolutionary kernel technology that allows developers to write custom
code that can be loaded into the kernel dynamically, changing the way the kernel
behaves.

This tool provides us the flexibility to build bespoke tools or customized
policies. eBPF-based tools can observe any event across the kernel, and hence
across all applications running on a (virtual) machine, whether they are
containerized or not.

Just a few of the things you can do with eBPF include:

+ Performance tracing of pretty much any aspect of a system.
+ High-performance networking, with built-in visibility.
+ Detecting and (optionally) preventing malicious activity.
